# ProtoType
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you create new objects by cloning existing ones, instead of instantiating them from scratch.

1. Creating a new object is expensive, time-consuming, or resource-intensive.
2. You want to avoid duplicating complex initialization logic.
3. You need many similar objects with only slight differences.
4. It exposes a clone() or copy() method that returns a new instance with the same data.

## Benefits
1. Preserves encapsulation
2. Eliminates the need to know the concrete class
3. Makes the system more flexible and extensible
