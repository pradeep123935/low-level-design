# Facade Design Pattern
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified, simplified interface to a complex subsystem making it easier for clients to interact with multiple components without getting overwhelmed by their intricacies.

It’s particularly useful in situations where:
1. Your system contains many interdependent classes or low-level APIs.
2. The client doesn’t need to know how those parts work internally.
3. You want to reduce the learning curve or coupling between clients and complex systems.
