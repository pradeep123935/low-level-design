# Factory Design Pattern
The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

It’s particularly useful in situations where:
1. The exact type of object to be created isn't known until runtime
2. Object creation logic is complex, repetitive, or needs encapsulation.
3. You want to follow the Open/Closed Principle, open for extension, closed for modification.
