/*
 * A Quick Note on Cloning:
* Shallow Copy: This implementation performs a shallow copy. It’s fine if all fields are primitives or immutable (like String). But if Enemy had a field like a List, both the original and cloned enemies would share the same list object, which can cause subtle bugs.
* Deep Copy: If your object contains mutable reference types, you should create a deep copy in the copy constructor. For example:
* Java’s built-in Object.clone() is often avoided due to its limitations and shallow behavior. Manual cloning using copy constructors or builders is more flexible and safer.
