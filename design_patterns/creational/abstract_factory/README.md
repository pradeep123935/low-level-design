# Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

It’s particularly useful in situations where:
1. You need to create objects that must be used together and are part of a consistent family (e.g., GUI elements like buttons, checkboxes, and menus).
2. Your system must support multiple configurations, environments, or product variants (e.g., light vs. dark themes, Windows vs. macOS look-and-feel).
3. You want to enforce consistency across related objects, ensuring that they are all created from the same factory.
